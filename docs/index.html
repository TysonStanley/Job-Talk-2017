Mediator or outcome is **categorical/non-normal**:]]

![](fig_binarymediator.jpg)

???
  - Mediation struggles with categorical/non-normal mediators/outcomes
  - For example, 
    - if X is continuous, M is binary, and Y is continuous the diagram shows how we would often model each path
    - So, how do you create a meaningful effect size when trying to combine logistic and linear regression?
  - Ultimately, to have any meaningful interpretation, **need additive**

So its not good. But to reiterate, consider the next slide.

$$

.large[The marginal effect of, say,] `\(X_1\)` .large[is:]

$$
]

???
  - Consider the *marginal effect* -- the thing you want in regression -- in two situations (**feel free to ignore the math**)
    - Linear
    - Logistic
      - In logistic the marginal effect depends on the values of all the predictors 
      - and it is just plain ugly compared to linear regression

The takeaway --&gt; Marginal Effect depends on all covariates

Ultimately, mediation doesn't work well with categorical mediators/outcomes. But people are using those, right? So what are the common approaches?

  - Ultimately, nothing great.

Luckily, there is a simple technique known as Average Marginal Effects.

# A Better Approach

$$
\text{Marginal Effect (Logistic)} = \frac{e^{\beta_0 + \sum_j^p \beta_j X_j + e_i}}{(1 + e^{\beta_0 + \sum_j^p \beta_j X_j + e_i})^2}
$$

2. Take the *average* of the marginal effects = AME
3. Works for any type of GLM (and GLMM)

.large[.nicegreen[Let's us interpret GLM's just like linear regression]]

???
ie, a one unit increase in the predictor is associated with an X unit increase in the outcome

Benefits:

1. Represents the observed effects in the sample
2. Is additive (can be combined with other additive measures)
3. Is used in other two-part models (hurdle models)

# Average Marginal Effects

#### Definition: Continuous Variable
$$
AME_k = \beta_k \frac{1}{n} \sum_i^n f(\beta X_i)
$$

$$
AME_k = \frac{f(\beta_k [x_k + h] + \beta X) - f(\beta_k x_k + \beta X)}{h}
$$

--

#### Definition: Dummy Coded Variable
$$
AME_{k} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_i^n [ F(\beta X | x_k = 1) - F(\beta X | x_i = 0) ]
$$

.center[.large[.dcoral[EXAMPLE]]]


???
  - Simply, they are the average of the marginal effects
    - with the observed values in place (no crazy or impossible values)
    - without diving into the math here, both are taking the average effect of a one unit increase in the `\(kth\)` variable
  - In other words, take the predicted value at some level of the predictor, then add one to the predictor and take the prediction again. The difference is the marginal effect.
  - In a paper I'm working on right now, it shows the AME is a consistent estimator of the underlying latent effect (probability, count, etc.)

  - The conditions tested will be broad for basic understanding of the method's behavior
  - Sample size: basic for what is needed for logistic

  - Next few (proportion and distribution) are because logistic is involved
  - Bootstrap size (hopefully 500 is sufficient)
  
Outcomes will be:

1. bias (i.e., is the mean of the estimates at the population mean?), 
2. power (i.e., how often does the null properly get rejected?), 
3. confidence interval coverage (i.e., does the confidence interval cover the proper interval?), and 
4. how closely `\(a \times b + c'\)` is to `\(c\)` (i.e., does the indirect plus the direct effect equal the total effect?)

???
  - One of the main advantages
  - However, given the number of combination of variable types, it is best to consider some basic interpretation principles
  - Review principles and show meaning in figure
    1. So with M being binary, the AME is a Marginal Probability or Risk
      - A one unit increase in X is associated with a .23 increase in the risk of M.
    2. In other words, it is the effect of X on Y through M (it should be in the outcomes units)
      - A one unit increase in X is associated with a `0.23 * 1.5 = 0.345` increase in the count of Y.
    3. No big surprises here since these are essentially the regression.

Replication of Ford and Hill (2012) that used categorical mediators and outcomes

1. Demonstrates the use of Marginal Mediation Analysis
2. Demonstrates the interpretability increase in using MMA over the (good) approach of Ford and Hill
3. Highlights important (potentially) causal pathways leading to substance use
