Mediator or outcome is **categorical/non-normal**:]]

![](fig_binarymediator.jpg)

???
  - Mediation struggles with categorical/non-normal mediators/outcomes
  - For example, 
    - if X is continuous, M is binary, and Y is continuous the diagram shows how we would often model each path
    - So, how do you create a meaningful effect size when trying to combine logistic and linear regression?
  - Ultimately, to have any meaningful interpretation, **need additive**

So its not good. But to reiterate, consider the next slide.

]

???
  - Consider the *marginal effect* -- the thing you want in regression -- in two situations (**feel free to ignore the math**)
    - Linear
    - Logistic
      - In logistic the marginal effect depends on the values of all the predictors 
      - and it is just plain ugly compared to linear regression

The takeaway --> Marginal Effect depends on all covariates

Ultimately, mediation doesn't work well with categorical mediators/outcomes. But people are using those, right? So what are the common approaches?

# A Better Approach
## Use Average Marginal Effects

.huge[.dcoral[Background:]]

$$
\text{Marginal Effect (Logistic)} = \frac{e^{\beta_0 + \sum_j^p \beta_j X_j + e_i}}{(1 + e^{\beta_0 + \sum_j^p \beta_j X_j + e_i})^2}

.large[.nicegreen[Interpret GLM's just like linear regression]]

???
ie, a one unit increase in the predictor is associated with an X unit increase in the outcome

Benefits:

1. Represents the observed effects in the sample
2. Is additive (can be combined with other additive measures)
3. Is used in other two-part models (hurdle models)

---
# Average Marginal Effects

#### Definition: Continuous Variable
$$
AME_k = \frac{f(\beta_k [x_k + h] + \sum_j^p \beta_j x_j) - f(\beta_k x_k + \sum_j^p \beta_j x_j)}{h}
$$

<br>

--

#### Definition: Dummy Coded Variable
$$
AME_{k} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_i^n [ F(\beta X | x_k = 1) - F(\beta X | x_i = 0) ]
$$

???
  - Simply, they are the average of the marginal effects
    - with the observed values in place (no crazy or impossible values)
    - without diving into the math here, both are taking the average effect of a one unit increase in the $kth$ variable
  - In other words, take the predicted value at some level of the predictor, then add one to the predictor and take the prediction again. The difference is the marginal effect.
  - In a paper I'm working on right now, it shows the AME is a consistent estimator of the underlying latent effect (probability, count, etc.)

???
  - One of the main advantages
  - However, given the number of combination of variable types, it is best to consider some basic interpretation principles
  - Review principles and show meaning in figure
    1. So with M being binary, the AME is a Marginal Probability or Risk
      - A one unit increase in X is associated with a .23 increase in the risk of M.
    2. In other words, it is the effect of X on Y through M (it should be in the outcomes units)
      - A one unit increase in X is associated with a `0.23 * 1.5 = 0.345` increase in the count of Y.
    3. No big surprises here since these are essentially the regression.
