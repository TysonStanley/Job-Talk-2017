This figure shows the prevalence per 1000 adolescents across hearing loss level and laterality of the loss. 
There does look to be an increase with a precipitous drop in 2010. 
Ultimately, we can't conclude it is increasing.
Models suggested differences between 1994 and 2008 were common across combinations of degree and laterality.
But no differences between 1994 and 2010.
Is it due to sampling??
We need more data but NHANES stopped collecting this data in 2010
Ultimately, however, adolescent hearing loss is still an important public health risk (3 - 5% of kids)

???
Graphically we can pick out some immediate trends:

1. The first day in hospital is most expensive (much of it driven by therapy costs with some diagnostic costs)
2. Variable and fixed costs contribute approximately equally to total costs across the first 20 days
3. The general pattern of high day one costs then a drop in costs holds across the CICU, PICU and General Care
4. Costs are lower for uninsured compared to private and government insurance

These findings extend previous findings in the ICU; showing costs are not uniformly distributed across days.

Cost reduction techniques, if shaving off one of the last days at the risk of the individual re-visiting, may not be doing as much as previously thought.

Also interesting is the difference between insurance types. If the uninsured that are receiving cheaper care have equal outcomes to others, this is important.


Now we are going to switch gears a bit and discuss how I'm helping researchers help individuals

# But...

.large[
When the mediator or outcome is **categorical/non-normal**, mediation analysis lacks:

- intuitive interpretation (e.g., total effect doesn't equal total effect?)
- defined effect sizes (indirect or total) or meaningful confidence intervals
]
--

.large[**Why?**]

![](fig_binarymediator.pdf)

???
  - Mediation struggles with categorical/non-normal mediators/outcomes
  - For example, 
    - if X is continuous, M is binary, and Y is continuous the diagram shows how we would often model each path
    - So, how do you create a meaningful effect size when trying to combine logistic and linear regression?
  - Ultimately, to have any meaningful interpretation, **need additive**

So its not good. But to reiterate, consider the next slide.

---
# Why the big fuss?

.pull-left[
#### Linear Model

$$
Y = \beta_0 + \sum_j^p \beta_j X_j + e_i
$$

The marginal effect of, say, `\(X_1\)` is:
$$
\frac{\delta Y}{\delta X_1} = \beta_1
$$
]

--

.pull-right[

#### Logistic Regression

$$
logit(Y) = \beta_0 + \sum_j^p \beta_j X_j + e_i
$$
$$
\frac{Prob(Y = 1)}{1 - Prob(Y = 1)} = e^{\beta_0 + \sum_j^p \beta_j X_j + e_i}
$$

$$
Prob(Y = 1) = \frac{e^{\beta_0 + \sum_j^p \beta_j X_j + e_i}}{1 + e^{\beta_0 + \sum_j^p \beta_j X_j + e_i}}
$$

The marginal effect of, say, `\(X_1\)` is:
$$
\frac{\delta Y}{\delta X_1} = \frac{e^{\beta_0 + \sum_j^p \beta_j X_j + e_i}}{(1 + e^{\beta_0 + \sum_j^p \beta_j X_j + e_i})^2}
$$
]

???
  - Consider the *marginal effect* -- the thing you want in regression -- in two situations (**feel free to ignore the math**)
    - Linear
    - Logistic
      - In logistic the marginal effect depends on the values of all the predictors 
      - and it is just plain ugly compared to linear regression

The takeaway --&gt; Marginal Effect depends on all covariates

Ultimately, mediation doesn't work well with categorical mediators/outcomes. But people are using those, right? So what are the common approaches?

  - There are five common approaches, but we don't have time to talk about each
  - Ultimately, nothing great.

Luckily, in economics especially, there is a simple technique known as Average Marginal Effects.

# Average Marginal Effects

.large[
The *average* of the marginal effects for any type of GLM:
]

--

.pull-left[
#### Definition: Continuous Variable
$$
AME_k = \beta_k \frac{1}{n} \sum_i^n f(\beta x_i)
$$
where `\(f\)` is the derivative of the estimate with respect to `\(x_i\)`, the `\(\beta x_i\)` is the linear combination of the predictors, and `\(AME_k\)` is the average marginal effect for the `\(kth\)` variable. 
]

--

.pull-right[
#### Definition: Dummy Coded Variable
$$
AME_{k} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_i^n [ F(\beta x_i | x_i = 1) - F(\beta x_i | x_i = 0) ]
$$
where `\(F(\beta x_i | x_i = 1)\)` is the predicted value of the `\(ith\)` observation when the dummy variable equals one and `\(F(\beta x_i | x_i = 0)\)` is the predicted value when the dummy value equals zero. 
]

???
  - Simply, they are the average of the marginal effects
    - with the observed values in place (no crazy or impossible values)
    - without diving into the math here, both are taking the average effect of a one unit increase in the `\(kth\)` variable
  - In other words, take the predicted value at some level of the predictor, then add one to the predictor and take the prediction again. The difference is the marginal effect.
  - In a paper I'm working on right now, it shows the AME is a consistent estimator of the underlying latent effect (probability, count, etc.)

.large[.large[To test its .dcoral[accuracy] and .dcoral[power], I performed a Monte Carlo Simulation]]

# Monte Carlo Simulation

#### The "a" Path Population Model 
- where the `\(Prob(M = 1)\)` is a latent continuous variable with a linear or logistic relationship with the predictors
- the `\(e_i\)` is normally distributed with `\(M = 0\)` and `\(SD = 1\)`.
$$
Prob(M = 1)_i = a_0 + a_1 x_c + a_2 x_d + e_i
$$
The observed variable, `\(M_i\)`, is defined as follows: `\(M_i = 0\)` if `\(Prob(M = 1) &lt; .5\)` and `\(M_i = 1\)` otherwise.

--

#### The "b" and "c'" Path Population Model
$$
Y_i = b_0 + b_1 M_i + c'_1 x_c + c'_2 x_d + e_i
$$
where this `\(e_i\)` also is normally distributed with `\(M = 0\)` and `\(SD = 1\)`.

- `\(x_c\)` is a continuous predictor
- `\(x_d\)` is a dummy coded predictor

???
  - The known population model consist of a binary M and continuous (approx normal) outcome
  - A path has a latent probability variable that maps onto a discrete mediator
  - B and C path is essentially a multiple linear regression

---
# Monte Carlo Simulation

.huge[.dcoral[Conditions] Varied for the simulation:]

.large[.large[
- Varying sample size (100 - 1000)
- Varying effect size of each path (small, medium, large)
- Varying Mediator's distribution (binomial, poisson)
]]

--

.large[.large[Each condition will have 500 replications]]

???
  - The conditions tested will be broad for basic understanding of the method's behavior
  - Sample size: basic for what is needed for logistic
  - Effect sizes range from small to big
  - Next few (proportion and distribution) are because logistic is involved
  - Bootstrap size (hopefully 500 is sufficient)
  
Outcomes will be:

1. bias (i.e., is the mean of the estimates at the population mean?), 
2. power (i.e., how often does the null properly get rejected?), 
3. confidence interval coverage (i.e., does the confidence interval cover the proper interval?), and 
4. how closely `\(a \times b + c'\)` is to `\(c\)` (i.e., does the indirect plus the direct effect equal the total effect?)


---
# Simulation Results





---
# Interpretation of Estimates

Since this method can handle all sorts of combinations of variable types, here are some interpretation guidelines.

.pull-left[
**Principle 1: The individual paths are interpreted based on the corresponding endogenous variable's original metric.**

&lt;/br&gt;

**Principle 2: The indirect effect, as a combination of the a and b paths, are interpreted based on the outcome's original metric.**

&lt;/br&gt;

**Principle 3: Both the direct and total effects are interpreted based on the outcome's original metric.**
]

.pull-right[
&lt;img src="JobTalk_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]


???
  - One of the main advantages
  - However, given the number of combination of variable types, it is best to consider some basic interpretation principles
  - Review principles and show meaning in figure
    1. So with M being binary, the AME is a Marginal Probability or Risk
      - A one unit increase in X is associated with a .23 increase in the risk of M.
    2. In other words, it is the effect of X on Y through M (it should be in the outcomes units)
      - A one unit increase in X is associated with a `0.23 * 1.5 = 0.345` increase in the count of Y.
    3. No big surprises here since these are essentially the regression.
